# The Agariyas: Blockchain-Powered Donation Platform

## Blockchain Integration Overview

### Technologies Utilized
- **Blockchain Framework**: Ethereum Blockchain
- **Network**: Sepolia Testnet (for development and testing)
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Ethers.js
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js React
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript

### Current Capabilities
- Secure, transparent cryptocurrency donations
- Real-time network switching
- MetaMask wallet connection
- Decentralized donation tracking
- Robust error handling and type-safe blockchain interactions

### Technical Architecture
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Custom contract integration allowing direct blockchain donations
- **Wallet Connectivity**: Seamless MetaMask integration for user-friendly crypto transactions
